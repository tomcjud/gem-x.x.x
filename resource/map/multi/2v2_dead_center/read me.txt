2v2_Dead_Center is a small, clean, simple map that offers a lot of cover and aggressive technical play. 
This map, played at the diagonals offers an good amount of natural cover to make for
intense opening matches where players may be assaulted from a variety of angles in 
the center grave yard. Hull down positions and key strategic buildings in the city
offer great amounts of tactical depth. 
A lot of fighting will happen naturally around the 130 range
forcing aggressive tactical play.

Intended for for MOW:AS matches.


Assault Zones, Combat, and Day of Victory should be working.
Map tested on a W64 system with 4 gigs of ram and an ati4870 and ran well.
Some slow down experienced during .04 and .06 testing in the urban area. Useless structures & objects removed. 
The 1.0 update only contains some additional stamps and some minor texture work
